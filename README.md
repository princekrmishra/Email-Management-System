# Email-Management-System
This project automates the retrieval, processing, and response to emails. It connects to a Gmail account using IMAP and SMTP protocols, fetches recent emails, analyzes their content, and sends automated responses based on predefined criteria. This tool is ideal for handling repetitive email tasks, ensuring prompt replies, and improving productivity.

## Features and Functionalities
- **Email Retrieval:** Fetches emails from a Gmail inbox using IMAP.
- **Email Parsing:** Decodes email subjects, senders, and bodies for processing.
- **Automated Responses:** Sends predefined responses to emails based on subject or body content.
- **Multi-Part Email Support:** Handles multipart emails, including text and attachments.
- **Secure Authentication:** Utilizes environment variables to store sensitive credentials securely.

## Tech Stack and Dependencies

### Tech Stack
- **Python 3.7+**: Core programming language.

### Libraries and Dependencies
- **imaplib**: For connecting to the IMAP server and retrieving emails.
- **smtplib**: For sending emails via SMTP.
- **email**: For parsing and constructing email messages.
- **dotenv**: For securely managing environment variables.
- **os**: For handling environment variables and system operations.

## Limitations or Known Issues
1. **Limited to Gmail**: The current implementation is designed specifically for Gmail.
2. **Basic Criteria Matching**: Automated responses are based on simple keyword matching; advanced natural language processing is not implemented.
3. **Rate Limiting**: High-frequency usage may trigger Gmailâ€™s rate limits.
4. **Security Risk**: Storing credentials in environment variables can still pose a risk if not managed securely.
